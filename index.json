It is freely available online and it can run on any platform (dont be worried if you use a mac or unix platform). R is always available in different version, always use the latest version. R can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.  Click the download R on the second line and choose a CRAN mirror to download. It is recommended to choose the CRAN mirror close to your country.  Some functionality in R are organized in packages which contain several functions. mean() is a function in R that calulate the mean of several observations. n() is a function in the dplyr package that gives the number of observations in a group and the format of represenation in R is dplyr::n().  R Studio  R studio is is an open source software for R. It is always recommended to use R studio in other to fully understand and use all its functionality using the R syntax. R studio can be used for various purposes as we will see over time. R studio provide a good platform for the use of of R software through it user interface. The latest version of R studio for different platform can be downloaded Here.  R Markdown  R markdown is one tte cool features of R studio that enables your project to be reproduceable. R markdown can be used to generate your report in any format. A single R markdown file nicely combines your code for analysis and the some texts to generate your report. R markdown is free and open source and it is apackage in R. When you open an R session, R markdown can be installed using install.packages(\u0026quot;rmarkdown\u0026quot;).  Git/Github  Git is an open-source version control system. Version control systems manage the revisions made on your project or documents in a central repository. Git is the mostly used version control because it stores project or file changes efficiently. Git is a command line tool central around the github. Github is a place to store your projects and track the changes made to the project. Each project files are stored in a repository. Register for an account on GitHub. Download Git here. Open Git bash on your PC and run the following commands.  git config --global user.name \u0026quot;your_GitHub_Username_here\u0026quot; git config --global user.mail \u0026quot;your_email_here\u0026quot;   ","date":1564099200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1564099200,"objectID":"722d32e5bd28498d8963887b0c771241","permalink":"https://OlajumokeEvangelina.github.io/courses/course1/","publishdate":"2019-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/course1/","section":"courses","summary":"Learn how to use the R statistical software for all your analysis and projects without any prior knowledge of programming.","tags":["R","R studio","CRAN","CRAN mirror","dplyr","R markdown","Git","github","git bash","git config","open source","version control","R for dummies"],"title":"Software needed to get started","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The R package MetabolicSurv identifies metabolic biomarker signature for cancer patients (metabolic risk score) for metabolic data by discovering predictive metabolite for predicting survival and classifying patients into low and high risk group for mortality. Metabolic risk scores (classifiers) are constructed as a linear combination of predictive/important metabolites, prognostic factors and treatment effects if necessary.\nSeveral methods were implemented to estimate the metabolic risk score such as majority voting technique, LASSO, Elastic net, Supervised Principle component analysis and Supervised Partial least squares analysis. All estimation methods were evaluated within a $\\ell$-fold cross-validation loop. During the evaluation process, validation is accessed using the hazard ratios (HR) distribution of the test set.
